Accompanying code for the publication "Soil information on a regional scale: Two Machine Learning based approaches for predicting Ksat" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116418)

The code in this repository was used to preprocess input data, train the ML models and produce our results. The datasets produced in this study are freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6498011.
